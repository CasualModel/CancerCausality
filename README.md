# Breast-cancer-Wisconsin-Diagnostic

>Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer death in women after lung cancer.
>Advances in screening and treatment for breast cancer have improved survival rates dramatically since 1989. According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), there are more than 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in the United States. The chance of any woman dying from breast cancer is around 1 in 38 (2.6%).

## Description

#### Machine learning approach for healthcare
>The machine learning methodology has long been used in medical diagnosis. in this project features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
